            <h2 style="background-color:tomato; text-align:center;">Blinking the seconds away</h3>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">You blink.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">The movements of your eyelids seem to almost directly correspond with the ticks of the second hand moving on the clock above your bed. Your breathing is slow and almost methodical. This has been the case for a while, the blinking and breathing and time ticking and the earth spinning, but not to you. Your mind and body are still, outside the movements of your eyes and chest, up and down.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">You can't remember where the hour hand was when you started, or the minute hand. All your attention sits on the thin red line circling the black dot in the center of the timepiece.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">You can faintly hear the sound of crashing. A scream or two. Or three. You're not entirely sure. You can feel the heat against your skin, a spark, or zap coursing its way through you. The feeling of your heart attempting to halt itself inside of you. And through the piercing pain coming from inside of your body, you continue to blink and breathe and the fine red mark continues to tick on.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">You can feel smoke enter your lungs and the sharp liquid wash its way down your throat. The burning sensation from the two seemed to blend from the pit of your stomach and intensify. Suddenly a feeling of claustrophobia hits you. You can feel the shadows swarm around you, blurry faces of people appear in your vision. Moving in sync, swaying, ostensibly mocking you and your still state. And gradually, you feel as though your head is no longer attached to your body, and you're falling.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">Falling.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">Spiraling.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">Blinking.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">Breathing.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">The second hand continues to spiral.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And there you sit, alone in your room once again. You're quiet, and for a moment, you can hear the faint cough of the man in the apartment beside you. The TV in their living room reporting the third spike in deaths, the twentieth political scandal, the ninetieth racist remark from the president, the umpteenth black man killed. And you feel your head rest back on your shoulders. A melancholy weight settling over your head, flowing down your shoulders into your stomach and tingling your toes, which curled in the uncomfortable sensation. The glossy finish that tinted your eyes made your expression seem more dull, but the water that scratched its way down your cheeks and fell to your lap spoke more than you ever did. With a trembling hand, you followed the rest of the globe, placing the box of emotions back on its shelf. Shoving the ghosts back into their place and banishing the demons back to their cages.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And you're alone once again.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">Waiting for the fire to be put out.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">For the world to begin.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And for time to stop ticking.</p>


            <h2 style="background-color:tomato; text-align:center;">Balloons</h3>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">Have you ever experienced the feeling of weightlessness?</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">The sudden lift of your feet, the dullness of all the stimuli around you. The water dripping from your hands, the scratches on your knees from the concrete. The lifeless body hanging from the fence. The hurt that followed.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And the hurt feels weightless too. Like you know it's there, but if you shut your eyes tight enough you might forget about it. Or not feel it. Or not notice it. Or maybe it will unclench itself from the grip it held on your heart. Maybe it’ll stop squeezing and ripping and tearing and hurting.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">But your eyes feel weightless too. Like balloons were attached to the lids and it's prohibiting you from moving them. Your gaze fixated on a single point, a cracked fence, a lifeless corpse, a sign of lost hope, a sigil of broken promises.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And like the balloon, your body lifts off the ground, and you fly. It's gentle, and you recognize that a single stomp could send you tumbling. But it's more than a stomp, it's a wave. A tsunami forcing you under. Its cyclical current, dragging you further below the still sea. Or maybe it's a hurricane. A deadly typhoon with winds so strong it flicks you off the edge of the cliff where you stood.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And you fall.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And you fall.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And you fall.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And the ground that embraces you feels heavier than the seas that crushed you. Feels stronger than the winds that threw you. It's tighter than the hurt that gripped you. And yet all at once, with the twitch of your finger, the slip of a chair, the tick of a blade.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">It's gone.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And you’re weightless once again.</p>


            <h2 style="background-color:tomato; text-align:center;">Chicanery</h3>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">They sat alone on a deserted corner.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">My eyes never moved from their slouched body. Their ambiguous figure laid unmoving. If they hadn't been upright, and I hadn't seen the clouds of their breath dissipating in the frigid air, I'd have said they were dead. They stared at the jagged ground–my eyes followed. Bits of broken glass decorated the worn street, glimmering in the light of a lone streetlamp.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;"><i>I walk over as they stand. They tower over and stare down at me, I watch their nose flare in anger. I stare into the voids of my doom, as my feet become water and freeze to the cold ground. Before I have the chance to break the ice and dash for safety, they grab me. I scream into the chasm of an empty street. Nobody answers. They cover my mouth, silencing me–not that my voice seemed to travel anywhere. And soon after, they whisk me away into the dark winter night.</i></p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">I tremble as the figure turns their head to the side, shifting the weight they sat on, before swiveling back to the shattered pieces of regret.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">With a breath, I walk over.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">I hold out the mug, my hands still shaking from the cold and fear. I look down at it, refusing to look into the holes of the empty. Instead, I focus on the water that bounce off the cup and melt into the air.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;"><i>Hands slowly wrap themselves around mine.</i> But I don't feel the weight of my body getting crushed to a large figure, or feel the world spin as I fade off into nothingness. Rather, I feel the cup gently leave my grasp, a soft "thank you," fills the silence.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">Finally, I look up.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">She smiles and ducks her head, taking a sip and rubbing her bright red fingers on the cup. Now I see her. Her busted, broken jacket doing little to protect her from the brutal wind. Her shoes and hands were similar: they were both scuffed and scratched. Her fingers weren't the only things stained red. I shook my head and watched her sip the tea until it was nothing but a memory.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">And I looked upon her, guilty for allowing myself to get caught up in an illusion, delusion, fantasy, deception of what-ifs.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">Then, I said something that I think was long overdue.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-family:courier;">"Would you like to come inside?"</p>
